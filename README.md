# project-refractra-prediction
Predicts eye refractive power using Gradient Boosting and lifestyle data. Flask-based ML web app.
# 👁️ Project E – Refractive Power Prediction

A machine learning–based web application that predicts a user’s **refractive eye power (in diopters)** based on simple **lifestyle and health-related inputs** such as screen time, sleep, diet, and more.

This project aims to assist in **early awareness** of potential vision issues, especially in areas with limited access to clinical eye testing.
